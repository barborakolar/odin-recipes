        <p>The Black Olive Martini is a study in restraint—elegant, austere, and unapologetically savory. Where the classic martini flirts with delicacy, this version leans into depth and contrast. The black olive brine introduces a quiet umami note, darker and rounder than its green counterpart, while the orange bitters offer a faint citrus flicker at the edge. It’s a drink built on subtraction—nothing unnecessary, every element purposeful, like the exposed concrete of a brutalist facade.</p>
        <p>This cocktail doesn’t aim to be liked; it demands to be understood. It’s best suited for late hours and sharp minds—structured to slow the drinker down and sharpen their focus. There’s no sweetness to hide behind, no garnish flash to distract. Just bitter, briny clarity in a cold glass. A martini for architects, minimalists, and those tired of compromise.</p>
