        <p>The Cucumber Wasabi Collins is a modernist twist on the classic highball—cool, linear, and quietly provocative. It opens with the spa-like freshness of muddled cucumber, quickly sharpened by bright lemon and the precision of a botanical gin. Just when you expect it to settle into familiar territory, the wasabi adds a sharp, clean heat that cuts through the coolness like a structural beam through glass. It’s refreshment with a point of view—subtle in profile but far from safe.</p>
        <p>This cocktail is all about balance and tension. The soda water stretches the palate, making room for the wasabi’s heat to emerge slowly, never overpowering. It's ideal for daytime architecture tours, rooftop conversations, or as a reset button after too many over-complicated drinks. The Cucumber Wasabi Collins isn’t loud, but it speaks clearly—and with intent.</p>
