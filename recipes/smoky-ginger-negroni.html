        <p>The Smoky Ginger Negroni is a bold reimagining of the classic Negroni, designed for those who prefer edge over elegance. Mezcal replaces gin, injecting a deep smokiness that transforms the traditionally crisp cocktail into something darker and more elemental. The addition of ginger syrup sharpens the bitterness of Campari with a punch of heat, creating a layered flavor profile that moves from sweet to bitter to spicy in one sip. It’s not a drink that blends in—it demands your attention and rewards slow, intentional sipping.</p>
        <p>Visually minimal but conceptually rich, this cocktail plays on contrast and tension. The bright orange hue hints at warmth, but the first taste surprises with smoke and spice. It’s ideal for an evening where conversation matters more than volume, and where your drink should say as much as your words. The Smoky Ginger Negroni is not for purists—it is for the curious, the experimental, and those tired of drinking the same thing twice.</p>
